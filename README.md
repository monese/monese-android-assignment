## The purpose of this test

The purpose of this test is to see how you approach a problem and what your solution looks like.
The requirements for this test are simple and should be straightforward to grasp. When implementing a solution, please keep things simple as well.

### Requirements

Implement SpaceX launches informative application:

As a user, I want to see the list of launches, when I open the application.
- For each launch in the list, next attributes should be displayed: mission name and launch date.

As a user, I want to have possibility to filter the list and see only successful launches.
- Parameter “success” should be used for filtering data

As a user, when I press on the launch in the list I want to see the next screen with rocket description


The application should display a loading indicator if it is fetching data.
The application should allow a user to refresh the data.

LaunchesFragment should be refactored.


The application should use Open Source REST API that can be found here: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API

Please implement your solution as an application that we can try (.apk). Please send us the link to your private repository with the source code.
